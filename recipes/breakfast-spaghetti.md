# Breakfast Spaghetti

This is an interesting recipe (I believe) from WW2. From my great uncle.
-- 
## Ingredients 

One serving:

- 1 Strip of Bacon
- 1 Egg
- 80g spaghetti
- 1/4 cup cream
- black pepper

1. Boil the pasta in salted water.
2. Put bacon in a cold pan and bring up to temperature to render all the fat.
3. Whisk the egg and cream together in a separate bowl.
4. When the pasta is done, strain and add it to the bacon. Fry it in the fat for about 1 minute, then turn off the heat.
5. Add the egg mixture and stir. When the egg mixture just begins to gently set and form soft curds, remove from the heat. It's done.


Additions:

You can add parmesian or other cheese at the end, but it's not necessary. If you add a lot of cheese, the cream becomes redundant.
