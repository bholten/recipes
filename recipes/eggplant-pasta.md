# Eggplant Pasta



---

## Ingredients
- Half of an eggplant
- Garlic
- Anchovies
- Olive oil
- Calabrian chile
- Basil
- Cherry tomatoes
- Pecorino cheese

Add cubed eggplant, adjust oil if it absorbs. Generally 1/4th of an eggplant per person, but adjust. Let brown to whatever you want

Slice and fry the garlic in olive oil. 

Slice and add the calabrian chiles to the oil. 

Slice an add the anchovies and mix until they dissolve.

After the eggplant is golden and fried, add the cherry tomatoes

Add Basil at the end to finish.

## Additions you can make
If you don't have Calabrian Chiles, probably crushed red pepper flakes are the best substitute, but habanero, anaheim, serrano, or jalepenos might work

Meat: guanciale, bacon, pancetta, pork belly

Cook these first and fry the garlic etc. in the rendered fat

Capers -- Add at the end. Briney flavor is nice with the anchovies

Lemon zest -- for some acidity to balance the richness.

Fried breadcrumbs -- for better texture
