## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Dry-Brine the Roast
- Rub the beef roast all over with the dry rub mixture.
- Place it uncovered or loosely wrapped in the fridge overnight.

### 2. Sear the Roast
- Remove the roast from the fridge 1 hour before cooking to come to room temperature.
- Preheat oven to **320°F (160°C)**.
- Pat the roast dry if needed.
- In a cast-iron Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
- Sear the roast on all sides until deeply browned. Remove and set aside.

### 3. Build the Braise
- In the same pot, add the sliced onions, carrots, and celery.
- Sauté for 5–7 minutes until softened and starting to brown.
- Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute.
- Pour in the beef stock and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
- Add the bay leaf.
- Nestle the roast back into the pot. Add a little water if needed—liquid should come no more than two-thirds of the way up the roast.

### 4. Braise the Roast
- Cover the pot **with the lid cracked** slightly to allow steam to escape.
- Place in the oven and braise for **3 hours**, turning the roast once every hour.
- When the roast begins to feel tender but still holds together, stop turning to preserve the crust.

### 5. Add Vegetables and Finish Uncovered
- Add the potatoes and carrots around the roast in the pot.
- **Remove the lid completely** and return to the oven for **1 hour**, or until the vegetables are tender and the roast has developed a crust on top.

### 6. Rest and Serve
- Remove from oven and let rest 15 minutes.
- Skim fat from the surface of the braising liquid if desired.
- Slice or shred the roast and serve with vegetables and a spoonful of broth—or reduce the liquid on the stovetop to concentrate it into a sauce.

## 👩‍🍳 Cook’s Note

> In our family, we always turn the roast once every hour during the braise. While not strictly necessary, this tradition helps the meat cook more evenly and ensures all sides get time both submerged in the flavorful broth and exposed to dry heat. As the roast becomes tender, we stop turning to let a crust form on top. This small ritual, passed down from my grandmother to my mother and now to me, gives the pot roast its signature texture: meltingly tender inside, with a beautifully seasoned, crusty top. We think it’s worth the care.
