# Grandmother’s Coq au Vin

This is a deeply aromatic, garlic-rich chicken dish slowly braised in red wine and brandy. Unlike many modern Coq au Vin recipes, the chicken is not fully submerged—allowing the skin to crisp and brown while the meat becomes tender. Bone-in thighs, bold herbs, and a generous hand with garlic define this deeply personal take on a French classic.

## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Brine the Chicken
- Combine wine, brandy, garlic, herbs, and spices in a bowl or zip-top bag.
- Add chicken thighs, skin side up, and refrigerate for **8–12 hours**.
- Remove chicken, **pat dry thoroughly**, and **reserve the brine** (strain out solids).
- Optional: If not keeping the skin on, **carefully remove it**, chop into small pieces, and render it in the pan instead of butter. Use the rendered chicken fat for searing the meat and vegetables. This technique was used occasionally by my grandmother for extra flavor and control.


### 2. Brown the Chicken
- Preheat oven to **325°F (160°C)**.
- Dust the chicken lightly with flour (especially the skin side).
- In a Dutch oven or braising pan, melt butter over medium-high heat.
- Sear chicken **skin side down** until golden and crisp, about 6–8 minutes.
- Flip and briefly brown the underside. Remove and set aside.

### 3. Build the Base
- In the same pot, add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook until softened and golden, ~8 minutes.
- Add sliced garlic and sauté for 1–2 minutes more.
- Deglaze with **reserved brine**, scraping up any fond.
- Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer.

### 4. Braise
- Return chicken thighs to the pot, **skin side up**, making sure the **skin is not submerged**.
- Cover **loosely** with a lid slightly ajar.
- Transfer to oven and braise for **45 minutes to 1 hour**, until meat is tender but the skin remains intact and slightly crisped.
- Return chicken thighs to the pot, skin side up, making sure the **skin is not submerged** if keeping it crisp.
- If skin has been removed and rendered, submersion is fine.

### 5. Prepare the Garnish
- While chicken braises, sauté bacon or pancetta in a pan until crisp. Remove and set aside.
- Sauté mushrooms in the rendered fat or additional butter until browned. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

### 6. Finish the Dish
- Optional: For a more refined presentation (as my grandmother often did), **remove the chicken and strain the braising liquid**, discarding the aromatics.
- Return the liquid to the pot and **reduce slightly**, whisking in a final pat of butter for gloss.
- Whisk in a final **pat of butter** to finish the sauce.
- Serve the sauce over the chicken or ladled separately.
- Scatter mushrooms and bacon over top.
- Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.

### Notes

- My grandmother often **strained out the mirepoix entirely** once it had given its flavor to the dish. She believed the sauce should be smooth and elegant, not chunky. If she wanted vegetables with the meal, she would **roast them separately** and serve them alongside.
- Whether or not she left the skin on depended on the day. Sometimes she kept it crisp; other times, she **rendered it separately** for depth of flavor and richness.

My mom makes a much more practical version of this dish—one that trades refinement for ease, and delivers all the comfort without all the steps.

- She never browns the chicken or crisps the skin; in fact, the skin is always removed.
- The mirepoix is chopped very roughly, just enough to break it down in cooking.
- Instead of layering the dish, she makes a quick roux with the mirepoix, then adds the wine, stock, and chicken all at once.
- Bacon is still sautéed separately, but mushrooms are added directly into the stew partway through the braise.
- The liquid is never strained, and the vegetables stay in for texture and simplicity.
