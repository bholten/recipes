# Cabbage Bacon Apple Salad
--
## Ingredients
Cabbages, sliced thin

Dressing:
salt and pepper
tablespoon white vinegar
tablespoon oil
cream

Toppings:
fry thinly-cut pork belly cubes, panchetta, or bacon
fry apple cubes
toss with cabbage and dressing

## Notes:

Salad is better if you let the dressing wilt the cabbage slightly

It's also nice to toss the cabbage and dressing and put in the refigerator before frying the bacon and apple
