# NYC Halal Rice

I learned this from a food truck in New York City. I have no idea what the ratios of spices were. Experiment on your own. I go heavy on the garlic, onion, and paprika. It's kind of like a super simplified chicken Biryani.

## Chicken and Rice

## Ingredients
Sauce:
- 1-1 ratio of Mayonaise and Yogurt
- Garlic Powder
- Lemon

Chicken Thighs

Marinate chicken thighs:
- Garlic powder
- Onion Powder
- Paprika
- Tumeric
- Thyme
- Oregano
- Salt
- Lemon

## Steps
Render the chicken in a cold pan with a bit of water. This will make the skin crispy.

Deglaze with onion or shallot

Add uncooked rice and toast it

Add water or chicken broth

Put chicken back in and simmer with the lid closed until rice is done

Serve with sauce
