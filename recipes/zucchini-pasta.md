# Zucchini Pasta
--
## Ingredients
- Half a zucchini
- Garlic
- Basil
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Lemon
- Parmesean or Pecorino cheese

## Steps
Cut the zucchini into thin coins

Fry gently in olive oil until golden

Add garlic to oil

Toss pasta in oil, adding pasta water as necessary

Mix cheese in

Mix fresh basil in

Finish with squeeze of fresh lemon juice

## Additions you can make
### More lemon
You can add lemon zest or much more lemon juice to make this a more lemon pasta.
### Herbs
I prefer basil in this recipe, but mint, parsley, and fennel fronds can be very nice. Use whatever you have.
### Spice
I also sometimes add red pepper flakes, but it totally changes the dish. If you want it spicy, I prefer pecorino to parmesan.
### Meat
If you add meat, I prefer light meat, like chicken breast, shrimp, or fish.

If you add shrimp or fish, consider holding the cheese and substituting bread crumbs, because the flavor of the seafood is too delicate against the cheese.
