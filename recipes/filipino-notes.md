## Chayote Pasta with Calamansi and Basil

---

# Ingredients

- 2 medium chayote (sayote), julienned or cut into thin ribbons
- 250g pasta (bihon if you want a local touch, or regular spaghetti/fettuccine)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 tbsp cold-pressed coconut oil (or neutral vegetable oil)
- Zest and juice of 2 calamansi (or 1 small lemon if preferred)
- ½ tsp patis (optional, for umami depth)
- A handful of fresh basil leaves, torn
- Toasted bread crumbs mixed with a pinch of salt and garlic powder (as a Parmesan alternative)
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions:

- Prep the chayote – Peel and slice into thin ribbons (use a julienne peeler or mandoline for even strips). Blanch in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then immediately rinse under cold water to retain some crunch.
- Cook the pasta – In salted boiling water, cook until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving ¼ cup pasta water.
- Sauté – In a pan, heat coconut oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.
- Combine – Add the chayote, stir briefly, then toss in the cooked pasta.
- Balance flavors – Add calamansi zest and juice, season with salt, pepper, and patis (if using). Add a splash of pasta water to loosen if needed.
- Finish – Toss in fresh basil at the last moment, then sprinkle with toasted bread crumbs for texture.
- Serve – Drizzle with a bit more oil if desired, and serve immediately.
