## Instructions 

This is one of my mom's favorites. Mushroom, leek, thyme, garlic has a very woodsy flavor and is one 
of my favorite combinations.

For mushrooms, I think Cremini and Shitake work best. If you use dried Shitake mushrooms, you can
use the water you rehydrate them with as the stock. 

For potatoes, I like to use a combo of Russet, Yukon Gold, and red. You can experiment a lot with what 
you like best.

The secret to this recipe is to saute the mushrooms until they are very brown, while never burning the 
butter. You can add a little bit of olive oil to keep the butter from burning.

Saute the mushrooms in a very little butter, just enough to get the pan wet, and grill them
for a very long time, until they begin to be very brown and stick to the bottom of the pan 
and leave brown fond. Add a pinch of salt to help draw out the moisture.

Then turn the heat down and add the very finely chopped leek, and a LOT of butter, and salt. 
Cook down until the leeks are soft and have given most of their flavor to the butter.
Again, make sure the butter doesn't brown.

Add the minced garlic and let fry in the butter for a minute or so.

If you are using dried thyme, add at this point, frying in the butter for 30 seconds or so helps the 
dried flavor bloom. If not, add at the end.

If you have white wine and cognac, it is nice to add some at this point. If you do, let the alcohol cook out 
before adding the chicken stock. This adds a bit of a fruity and sharper tone, but is very optional.

Add all of the stock. At this point begin to scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze the mushroom fond
at the bottom.

Add all of the chopped potatoes. I prefer different types of potatoes (Red and Yukon Gold) to give
different textures. Add more Yukon Gold to make it more creamy.

When the potatos are done, add a splash of whole milk and let come back to a simmer.

I prefer to lightly mash the potatoes in the pot, but you can blend the soup to make is super 
creamy or leave it more rustic and not mash it at all. I like somewhere in between.

Add salt, white pepper, and a dash of nutmeg for final seasonings.
