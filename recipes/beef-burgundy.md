# Grandmother’s Beef Burgundy (Boeuf Bourguignon)

This elegant, wine-braised beef stew is a memory of quiet care and kitchen craft. Cubed beef is brined in red wine and cognac with aromatic herbs, dusted in flour, and browned in butter. The sauce is silky, the flavors deep, and every detail—like adding the mushrooms and bacon separately—matters. A special dish for cold days, worthy of company or tradition.

## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Marinate the Beef
- In a large bowl or container, combine cubed beef, wine, cognac, garlic, herbs, and spices.
- Cover and refrigerate for **at least 12 hours**, preferably overnight.

### 2. Prep the Beef
- Remove beef from the marinade and **pat very dry** with paper towels.
- Strain the marinade and reserve the liquid.
- Discard (or compost) the aromatics.
- **Lightly dust the beef cubes with flour** on all sides.

### 3. Brown the Beef
- In a heavy Dutch oven, melt **4 tbsp butter** over medium-high heat.
- Brown the beef in batches—don’t overcrowd. Let it develop a crust.
- Remove and set aside.

### 4. Build the Base
- Lower heat to medium. Add the finely diced **onion, carrot, and celery** (your grandmother’s refined mirepoix).
- Cook until soft and golden, about 8–10 minutes.
- Deglaze with the **reserved wine brine**, scraping up any browned bits.
- Add the **beef stock**, enough to **fully submerge the meat**.
- Return beef to the pot.

### 5. Braise
- Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover tightly and transfer to a **325°F (160°C)** oven.
- Cook for **2½ to 3 hours**, or until the beef is fork-tender.

### 6. Prepare the Garnish
- While the stew braises, sauté bacon or pancetta in a pan until crisp. Remove and set aside.
- In the rendered fat (or with a little butter), sauté mushrooms until browned and tender. Remove and set aside.
- (Optional) In the same pan, **sauté pearl onions** in a bit of butter until golden and tender, about 10–15 minutes. Add a splash of water and cover briefly if needed to soften.
- Set all garnishes aside.

### 7. Finish the Sauce
- When the beef is done, **strain the braising liquid** into a saucepan (optional but elegant).
- Simmer to reduce until slightly thickened.
- Whisk in a **pat of cold butter** to finish the sauce—it adds gloss and richness.
- Return sauce to the beef (and optionally add the mirepoix back too).

### 8. Assemble & Serve
- Gently fold in the sautéed mushrooms, crisp bacon, and pearl onions.
- Taste and adjust seasoning.
- Serve hot, ideally with buttered noodles, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread.

## 📝 Notes

- **Wine:** Burgundy is traditional, but any dry red wine you’d happily drink will work.
- **Brine time matters.** This dish builds flavor *before* it even begins cooking.
- **Butter:** Yes, it’s a lot—but this isn’t a diet dish. It’s a dish full of soul and memory.
- **Optional glaze:** For an extra refined finish, reduce the sauce until nappe (coats the spoon) and strain again.

Though some versions of Beef Burgundy use tomato paste, my grandmother did not—she believed in cooking with ingredients that would spoil, because that meant they were real.
