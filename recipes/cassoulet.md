# Grandmother’s Cassoulet

This cassoulet was one of the most flavorful, rich, and comforting dishes my grandmother ever made—and it stood out for what she *didn’t* do. She never used breadcrumbs, believing the crust should come from the dish itself. She built it patiently, adding reserved liquid multiple times during roasting. Her cassoulet used rough-chopped vegetables, aromatic herbs, white beans, and a mix of caramelized meats. It was always hearty, never fussy, and cooked in just two pots and a roasting pan.

### For Roasting and Broth

## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Cook the Beans
- Soak the beans overnight or use a quick soak.
- Simmer with onion, bay leaves, and cloves for ~1 hour until tender but not falling apart.
- Salt toward the end of cooking. Reserve **1–2 cups** of the cooking liquid. Discard the clove-studded onion and bay leaves.

### 2. Roast the Meats
- Preheat oven to **450°F (230°C)**.
- Place sausages and pork shoulder or ham chunks in a roasting pan.
- Roast for 20–25 minutes, until well browned and caramelized.
- **Deglaze the roasting pan** with a splash of white wine or broth, scraping up the fond. **Add this to your reserved liquid or stock.**
- Optional: 2–4 tbsp duck fat (if available)

### 3. Prepare the Aromatics
- In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, melt duck fat (if using) or another fat of your choi
- Add onion, carrots, celery (if using), garlic, and chopped tomatoes.
- Add herbs (thyme, rosemary, bay) and season well with salt and pepper.
- Cook until softened and fragrant, about 10–15 minutes.

### 4. Assemble the Cassoulet
- Stir in cooked beans and the deglazing liquid or broth.
- Nestle the roasted meats into the bean mixture, **keeping some meat near the surface** for crust development.
- Add just enough liquid to come to the surface of the mixture—not swimming, but well-moistened.
- (Optional) If using pork rind, **lay it flat along the bottom** of your Dutch oven or earthenware pot. This prevents sticking and adds richness to the beans.
- Nestle in roasted sausages, pork, and duck (if using), keeping some meat near the surface for crust development.

### 5. Roast and Build the Crust
- Preheat oven to **325°F (160°C)**.
- Roast **uncovered** for about 2½ to 3 hours.
- Every 45–60 minutes, when a crust forms on top, gently **break the crust and ladle a bit of reserved bean liquid or stock** over it.
- Repeat this **2 to 3 times**. This process builds a deeply flavored, glossy surface without needing breadcrumbs.
- Optional: 2–4 tbsp duck fat (for sautéing the aromatics, if available)

## 📝 Notes

- My grandmother **never used breadcrumbs**, believing that a proper cassoulet builds its own crust naturally with time and care.
- She used **whatever meats were available**, but **pork sausage and smoked ham** were staples. Occasionally she added **roasted poultry or duck confit** when available.
- **Celery** may or may not have been part of the recipe, but its inclusion fits the general flavor profile.
- Her cassoulet used **rough-chopped vegetables** for depth, and **cloves in the bean pot** for a subtle warm undertone.
- Most importantly, she always **deglazed the roasting pan** and added it to the broth—nothing was wasted, and all flavor was preserved.
- My grandmother **sometimes lined the bottom of her pot with pork rind**—usually a brown, earthenware-style pot that tapered slightly. This step wasn't always used, but when it was, it added richness and protected the beans from scorching.
- She also used **duck meat or duck fat** whenever it was available—especially in the autumn or if friends had hunted locally. When it wasn’t, she simply made do with pork and sausage and it was no less satisfying.

## 🍽️ Serve With

- Crusty bread or nothing at all—this is a meal in itself.
- A sharp salad can balance the richness, but the cassoulet stands alone beautifully.
